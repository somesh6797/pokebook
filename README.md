the pokemon app will give info of alll pokemons

pokelist component will have the list of all comopnents
for the start we will add the 15 or so pokemons.


at first page we will provide the image and the name only and when the user clicks on the pokemon image then we will provide the all information like what is his powerlevel and all etc...


we will have a menu that will give the searched pokemon in that if spelled wrong then it might give the autocorrection ideas.


we then will try to turn it into  progressive web app. so it can be used on the mobile as well as some part of it  to be aviable offline.----->PWA's features
